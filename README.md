# Luxonis trainee task

## Goal
* Goal of this repo is to solve the trainee task from the Luxonis company.
Assignment is as follows
> Use scrapy framework to scrape the first 500 items (title, image url) from sreality.cz (flats, sell) and save it in the Postgresql database. Implement a simple HTTP server in python and show these 500 items on a simple page (title and image) and put everything to single docker-compose command so that I can just run "docker-compose up" in the Github repository and see the scraped ads on http://127.0.0.1:8080 page.
